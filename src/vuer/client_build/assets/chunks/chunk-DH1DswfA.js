component

This component enables real-world mesh detection in WebXR AR sessions.
It detects and renders environmental geometry like walls, floors, and furniture.

**Data Upload Modes:**
1. **Auto-Update Mode** (when \`autoUpdate: true\`, default):
   - Automatically detects mesh changes (new/updated/removed)
   - Pushes updates to server only when changes occur
   - Event type: 'WEBXR_MESH_UPDATE'
   - Set \`autoUpdate: false\` to disable

2. **RPC Mode** (always active):
   - Server sends 'GET_WEBXR_MESH' request with matching key
   - Component responds with latest mesh data
   - Response event type: rtype from request or 'GET_WEBXR_MESH_RESPONSE'

**Requirements:**
- WebXR session must be initialized with 'mesh-detection' feature
- Only works in immersive-ar mode
- Device must support mesh detection API`,groups:[{name:"appearance",gridCols:2},{name:"behavior"}]},{component:"SceneBackground",schemas:[{name:"src",dtype:"string",grouping:"scene"}],groups:[{name:"scene"}]},{component:"ImagePlane",schemas:[{name:"depthScale",dtype:"number",default:1,min:0,step:.01,grouping:"texture",value:1},{name:"depthBias",dtype:"number",default:0,step:.01,grouping:"texture",value:0},{name:"distanceToCamera",dtype:"number",default:10,step:.01,min:.1,grouping:"geometry",value:10},{name:"aspect",dtype:"number",step:.01,grouping:"geometry"},{name:"height",dtype:"number",step:.01,grouping:"geometry"},{name:"opacity",dtype:"number",min:0,max:1,step:.01,grouping:"appearance",value:1},{name:"position",dtype:"vector3",grouping:"transform"},{name:"rotation",dtype:"vector3",grouping:"transform"},{name:"fixed",dtype:"boolean",default:!1,grouping:"behavior",value:!1},{name:"side",dtype:"number-int",default:2,min:0,max:2,grouping:"appearance",value:2},{name:"layers",dtype:"number-int",grouping:"rendering",value:null},{name:"wireframe",dtype:"boolean",default:!1,grouping:"appearance",value:!1}],description:`Low-level image plane that renders pre-loaded Texture objects.

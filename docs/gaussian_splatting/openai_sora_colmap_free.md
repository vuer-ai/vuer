# 3D Scene Extraction from Sora Videos Without Colmap

A common critic of neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches
is that these methods rely on structure from motion (SfM) by [colmap](https://colmap.github.io/)
to infer the camera poses, and colmap does this by first reconstructing the scene
itself. In other words, to produce a NeRF or a 3DGS model, colmap first makes a 3D 
model that is thrown away, and then NeRF or 3DGS builds another one.

```{admonition} Structure from Motion Being A Common Bottleneck
:class: tip
Structure from Motion often becomes a bottleneck in a NeRF pipeline. It is 
brittle against multi-session inconsistency (your images from from multiple takes on 
different days, and the scene or the lighting condition has changed in-between); bad
camera angles (your camera is staring at a wall); and, or overall lack of view overlap
between the camera poses (photometry simply has no info for inferring the poses).
```

## Introducing Colmap-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting

[Colmap-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://oasisyang.github.io/colmap-free-3dgs/) is
a recent approach that relaxes this requirement. 


We run a few videos generated by sora through this colmap-free 3DGS pipeline and present
the live examples below. Note: the live example suffers from some quality loss due to the
compression we apply to the `.splat` files. This will be addressed by future updates.

We include three scenes:

1. [Art Museum](#art-museum)
2. [Big Sur](#big-sur) 
3. [Santorini](#santorini)

## Big Sur

Here is a live demo:

To run this python code locally, you need to install the `vuer` package 
```shell
pip install 'vuer[all]=={VERSION}'
```
Download the asset file at {download}`_static/colmap_free/big-sur.splat`

and run the following code:

```python
from asyncio import sleep
import numpy as np
from vuer import Vuer
from vuer.schemas import Splat

pi = 3.141592653
app = Vuer()
```
